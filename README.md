# pixijs-template
Pixi.js + Webpack + Babel

A minimal starting point for experiments with Pixi.js using Webpack and Babel to get the latest ES features.

## Usage

Clone the repository to use it as a starting point for your own Pixi.js experiments.

* `npm run start` - start the development server
* `npm run build` - build a deployable bundle

The entry point is `src/index.js` which already has a Pixi.js app initialized.
