# pixijs-template
Pixi.js + Webpack + Babel

A minimal starting point for experiments with Pixi.js using Webpack and Babel to get the latest ES features.

## Usage

Clone the repository to use it as a starting point for your own Pixi.js experiments and then remove the remote to clear the way for your own git repo usage

1) `git clone git clone git@github.com:alkamin/pixijs-template.git some-pixi-experiment`
2) `cd some-pixi-experiment`
3) `git remote rm origin`

The entry point is `src/index.js` which already has a Pixi.js app initialized.

### Scripts

* `npm run start` - start the development server
* `npm run build` - build a deployable bundle
